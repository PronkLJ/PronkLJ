ğŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is Lucas Pronk
I am a researcher at the department Design, Production & Management at the University of Twente, the Netherlands.
ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the ins and outs of ROS2, to be able to create a Digital Twin of our CRX10iA/L.
Any help in achieving this is greatly appreciated!
